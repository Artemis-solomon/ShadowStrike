## ShadowStrike User Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the ShadowStrike repository or download the script to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ShadowStrike.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Script Directory

Enter the script directory:

```bash
cd ShadowStrike/scripts
```

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable

Ensure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x shadowstrike.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the Script

Execute the script:

```bash
./shadowstrike.sh
```

### Step 5: Follow the Interactive Configuration

The script will prompt you for the following information:

- **Target Host:** Enter the IP address or hostname of the target.
- **Target Port:** Specify the port for the SSH service (default is 22).
- **Username List:** Provide the path to the file containing the list of usernames.
- **Password List:** Provide the path to the file containing the list of passwords.
- **Output File:** Specify the path for the file where successful logins will be recorded.

### Step 6: Confirm Configuration

Review the entered configuration. If correct, the script will save the configuration to `config.conf`.

### Step 7: Perform Resource Check

The script checks for the presence of necessary files (username and password lists) and the availability of the Hydra tool. Follow any prompts to address missing resources.

### Step 8: Execute the Brute Force Attack

The script utilizes Hydra to perform the brute force attack. Observe the progress messages and wait for the attack to complete.

### Step 9: Review Results

After the attack, review the results. Successful logins will be saved to the specified output file.

### Step 10: Repeat or Exit

The script will prompt you to decide whether to repeat the attack or exit. Choose 'y' to restart the script for another attack or 'n' to exit.

**Note:** ShadowStrike is intended for educational and ethical security testing. Use it responsibly and only on systems for which you have explicit authorization.

### Additional Tips:

- **Configuration Persistence:** The script saves the configuration in `config.conf`. If you want to change the configuration, run the script again.

- **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues, refer to the troubleshooting guide in the documentation or reach out for assistance.

### Step 11: Optional - Repeat the Process

If you chose to repeat the attack, the script will loop back to the beginning, allowing you to perform multiple iterations for learning and testing.
